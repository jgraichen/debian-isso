The Isso configuration file is an \fI\%INI\-style\fP textfile. It reads integers,
booleans, strings and lists. Here\(aqs the default isso configuration:
\fIisso.conf <https://github.com/posativ/isso/blob/master/share/isso.conf>\fP\&. A
basic configuration from scratch looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
dbpath = /var/lib/isso/comments.db
host = https://example.tld/
[server]
listen = http://localhost:1234/
.ft P
.fi

To use your configuration file with Isso, append \fB\-c /path/to/cfg\fP to the
executable or run Isso with an environment variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~> isso \-c path/to/isso.cfg

.SH GENERAL
.sp
In this section, you configure most comment\-related options such as database path,
session key and hostname. Here are the default values for this section:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
dbpath = /tmp/isso.db
name =
host =
max\-age = 15m
notify = stdout
log\-file =
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B dbpath
file location to the SQLite3 database, highly recommended to change this
location to a non\-temporary location!
.TP
.B name
required to dispatch multiple websites,
not used otherwise.
.TP
.B host
Your website(s). If Isso is unable to connect to at least on site, you\(aqll
get a warning during startup and comments are most likely non\-functional.
.sp
You\(aqll need at least one host/website to run Isso. This is due to security
reasons: Isso uses \fI\%CORS\fP to embed comments and to restrict comments only to
your website, you have to "whitelist" your website(s).
.sp
I recommend the first value to be a non\-SSL website that is used as fallback
if Firefox users (and only those) supress their HTTP referer completely.
.INDENT 7.0

.TP
.B notify
Select notification backend(s) for new comments, separated by comma.
Available backends:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP

When \fBgevent\fP is available, it is automatically used for \fIhttp://\fP
Currently, gevent can not handle http requests on unix domain socket
(see \fI\%#295\fP and
\fI\%#299\fP for details).
.sp
Does not apply for \fIuWSGI\fP\&.
.TP
.B reload
reload application, when the source code has changed. Useful for
development. Only works with the internal webserver.
.TP
.B profile
show 10 most time consuming function in Isso after each request. Do
not use in production.
.UNINDENT
.SH SMTP
.sp
Isso can notify you on new comments via SMTP. In the email notification, you
also can moderate (=activate or delete) comments. Don\(aqt forget to configure
\fBnotify = smtp\fP in the general section.

.TP
.B port
SMTP port
.TP
.B security
use a secure connection to the server, possible values: \fInone\fP, \fIstarttls\fP
or \fIssl\fP\&. Note, that there is no easy way for Python 2.7 and 3.3 to
implement certification validation and thus the connection is vulnerable to
Man\-in\-the\-Middle attacks. You should definitely use a dedicated SMTP
account for Isso in that case.
.TP
.B to
recipient address, e.g. your email address
.TP
.B from
sender address, e.g. \fI"Foo Bar" <isso@example.tld>\fP
.TP
.B timeout
specify a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the
connection attempt.
.UNINDENT
.SH GUARD

for IPv4, \fB/48\fP for IPv6).

purposes.
.TP
.B ratelimit
limit to N new comments per minute.
.TP
.B direct\-reply
how many comments directly to the thread (prevent a simple
\fIwhile true; do curl ...; done\fP\&.
.TP
.B reply\-to\-self
allow commenters to reply to their own comments when they could still edit
the comment. After the editing timeframe is gone, commenters can reply to
their own comments anyways.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the client.
.TP
.B require\-author
force commenters to enter a value into the author field. No validation is
performed on the provided value.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the client accordingly.
.TP
.B require\-email

performed on the provided value.
.sp
Do not forget to configure the client.
.UNINDENT

supported, but new languages are relatively easy to add.

.B options
\fI\%Misaka\-specific Markdown extensions\fP, all
flags starting with \fIEXT_\fP can be used there, separated by comma.
.TP
.B allowed\-elements
Additional HTML tags to allow in the generated output, comma\-separated. By
default, only \fIa\fP, \fIblockquote\fP, \fIbr\fP, \fIcode\fP, \fIdel\fP, \fIem\fP, \fIh1\fP, \fIh2\fP,
\fIh3\fP, \fIh4\fP, \fIh5\fP, \fIh6\fP, \fIhr\fP, \fIins\fP, \fIli\fP, \fIol\fP, \fIp\fP, \fIpre\fP, \fIstrong\fP,
\fItable\fP, \fItbody\fP, \fItd\fP, \fIth\fP, \fIthead\fP and \fIul\fP are allowed.
.TP
.B allowed\-attributes
Additional HTML attributes (independent from elements) to allow in the
generated output, comma\-separated. By default, only \fIalign\fP and \fIhref\fP are
allowed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To allow images in comments, you just need to add \fBallowed\-elements = img\fP and
\fBallowed\-attributes = src\fP\&.
.SH HASH
.sp
Customize used hash functions to hide the actual email addresses from
commenters but still be able to generate an identicon.
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B salt
A salt is used to protect against rainbow tables. Isso does not make use of
pepper (yet). The default value has been in use since the release of Isso
and generates the same identicons for same addresses across installations.
.TP
.B algorithm
Hash algorithm to use \-\- either from Python\(aqs \fIhashlib\fP or PBKDF2 (a
computational expensive hash function).
.sp
The actual identifier for PBKDF2 is \fIpbkdf2:1000:6:sha1\fP, which means 1000
iterations, 6 bytes to generate and SHA1 as pseudo\-random family used for
key strengthening.
Arguments have to be in that order, but can be reduced to \fIpbkdf2:4096\fP
for example to override the iterations only.
.UNINDENT
.SH APPENDUM
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Timedelta
A human\-friendly representation of a time range: \fI1m\fP equals to 60
seconds. This works for years (y), weeks (w), days (d) and seconds (s),
e.g. \fI30s\fP equals 30 to seconds.
.sp
You can add different types: \fI1m30s\fP equals to 90 seconds, \fI3h45m12s\fP
equals to 3 hours, 45 minutes and 12 seconds (12512 seconds).
